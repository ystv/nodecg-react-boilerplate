## Setting up

### GitHub Templates

Click the green "Use this template" button on this repository, which will create a new repository based on this one.

Clone your new repo into your NodeCG installation's `bundles` folder:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:<username>/my-awesome-bundle.git
```

Open `package.json` and change the `name` field to the name of your repository, otherwise NodeCG will refuse to start it.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Manual setup

Clone this repo into your NodeCG installation's `bundles` folder. You'll likely want to use a different name, like so:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ystv/nodecg-react-boilerplate.git my-awesome-bundle
```

If you used a different name, go into `package.json` and change the `name` field to the name of your folder, otherwise NodeCG will refuse to start it.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Usage

To start, run `yarn start`, and run NodeCG in a separate terminal.

To create additional dashboards/graphics, create files called `src/dashboard/index.{name}.tsx` or `src/graphics/index.{name}.tsx` - each one will be wrapped into a HTML page called `dashboard/{name}.html` or `graphics/{name}.html`. Then just reference it in `package.json` under `nodecg`. (If you want to customise the generated HTML, create a file called `index.{name}.html`.)

You can import files from the `src/common` folder simply by using `import foo from "common/foo"` no matter how deep you are in a directory hierarchy.

If you use NodeCG's [replicant schemas](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/replicant-schemas) or [bundle configuration](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/bundle-configuration), you can run `yarn schema` to generate a TypeScript declaration file from those schemas - these will be placed in `src/common/types`.

If you want to use Storybook with React, create files called `{name}.stories.tsx` following the [Storybook standards](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) and run `yarn storybook`.
